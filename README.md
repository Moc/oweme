# Owe Me!  #

Owe Me! is an e107 plugin that provides an overview of that what people owe you. You can create entries and include date, category, amount, description, debtor and the status of the entry.

Also, one is able to manage categories, debtors and statuses from the admin area.

This plugin is coded using e107 which includes **bootstrap and jquery standards**. 


## Requirements ##
* e107 v2.x
* PHP 5.3+
* Ability to read the wiki and/or search documentation for answers ;)

**To be clear**: e107 v1.x is not supported, nor is any PHP version prior to PHP 5.3! 

If you are running on anything lower than PHP 5.3,  you are over **FOUR YEARS  behind on schedule!** PHP 5.3.0 was released on the 30th of June 2009, do something!


## Roadmap - planned features ##
* Preferences/options (email settings)
* ~~Templating for frontend customization~~
* Email functionality (initial entry, reminders).
* Userclasses integration (debtors).
* Using *tabs* create/manage debtor, category and status instead of different pages
