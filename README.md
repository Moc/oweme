# Owe Me!  #

Owe Me! is an e107 plugin that provides an overview of that what people owe you. You can create entries and include date, category, amount, description, debtor and the status of the entry.

Also, one is able to add and edit categories, debtors and statuses from the admin area.


## Requirements ##
* e107 v2.x+
* PHP 5.3+
* Ability to read the wiki or search forums for answers ;)

To be clear: e107 v1.x is not supported, nor is any PHP version prior to PHP 5.3!

## Roadmap - planned features ##
* *Email* functionality (initial entry, reminders) .
* Different *types* of items that are owed (other than 'money').
* *Userclasses* integration (debtors).
* Somehow *link categories-debtors-types*. 
* *Icons* for categories, debtors, statuses.
